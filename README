there is single JUnit here org.khl.dbbench.DbBenchTest, 
which utilizes embedded derby for pulling many rows by two
different ways SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY ID - pullOneByOne()
and paginated 
SELECT * from FIRSTTABLE where id in (?,?,?,?..) - pullByBatches()
it proceeds 10000 rows by default in 100 rows batches. 
To scale data higher specify -Dtests.nightly=true.
pls find one-mln-run.png with result.
